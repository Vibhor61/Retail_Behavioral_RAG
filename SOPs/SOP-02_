SOP-02: Product Detailed Profile
1. SOP Number & Name

SOP-02 — PRODUCT_DETAILED_PROFILE

2. Intent it handles

User wants more details about a specific product after identification.

Typical phrases:

“more details”

“tell me everything”

“full details”

“describe it properly”

“give complete info”

3. Trigger conditions

Trigger only if:

A product is already identified confidently OR can be identified confidently from the request

User explicitly requests more detail (“more details / everything / full profile”)

This SOP must NOT trigger if the user asks specifically for:

"basic info" -> SOP Basic Info

“bought together” → SOP bought-together

“similar products” → SOP similar

“compare A vs B” → SOP comparison

“trend / peak time” → SOP timing/trend SOP



4. Required inputs

From identity resolution (embeddings used only to resolve):

resolved_product_id

From final table (allowed fields for this SOP):

Identity & placement

product_id

product_name

department_name

aisle_name

Descriptive_card

brand / size / material / color (only if they exist as columns)

Behavior & popularity (analytics)

total_orders

popularity_bucket

avg_cart_position

avg_order_hour

avg_order_day

bought_together_names with counts (top_k default 5)

Important: Do not use the embedding “Descriptive card” as the product description.
That text is for retrieval; answers must use structured fields.

5. Retrieval rules

Step 1 — Resolve product

embeddings: resolve product_id (no answering from embeddings)

Step 2 — Fetch product profile

query final table for the allowed fields above

if some fields are missing, skip those sections (don’t hallucinate)

6. Reasoning rules

Do not invent details not present in table

If a metric is missing/null, say “not available” or omit section

Keep analytics as observations, not claims of causality

If bought_together exists, present it as “often purchased with”

7. Response format (strict)

Always output in these sections in this order:

Product

Name, Department, Aisle

Description

Only if product_description exists

Shopping behavior

total_orders

popularity_bucket

avg_cart_position (interpret as early/mid/late only if you’ve defined buckets elsewhere; otherwise show the number plainly)

When it’s typically ordered

avg_order_hour

avg_order_day

Often purchased with

top 5 bought_together_names (if present)

No extra sections. No recommendations.

8. Failure / refusal conditions

Refuse if:

product cannot be resolved confidently

table lacks even basic fields (name/department/aisle)

Refusal style:

“I can’t reliably retrieve a complete profile for this product from the available data.”
